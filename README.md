## Process
- Firstly we fetched data of different states as per population,deaths,recoveries,total cases 
- Then we did pareto analysis with the help of cumulative frequency and percentage distribution so that we would be able to find which states are more    affected and which ones are less affected
- And grouped states according to some criteria in group 1 to group 6
- Then we created and inserted some charts on basis of these observation so that we would be able to analyse the data properly
- And Finally we created a dashboard with the help of these facts
